## Commands

```bash
npm run start:dev        # dev server (watch mode), port 3000
npm run build            # compile to dist/
npm run start:prod       # run compiled build
npm run lint             # ESLint --fix across src/ and test/
npm run test             # Jest unit tests (rootDir: src, matches *.spec.ts)
npm run test:watch       # Jest in watch mode
npm run test:e2e         # Jest e2e (test/jest-e2e.json)
npm run seed:cities      # seed cities table from CSV
npm run migration:run    # run TypeORM migrations via data-source.ts
npm run backfill:locations  # backfill PostGIS location column on profiles
```

Migrations are plain SQL files in `migrations/`, starting from a consolidated baseline `001_baseline.sql` (a `pg_dump --schema-only` snapshot — see its header). Migrations that predate the baseline (`002`–`043`) live in `migrations/_archive/` for history only and must never be replayed against a DB provisioned from the baseline. New migrations continue numbering from `002` in the active `migrations/` directory. They are **not** auto-run on startup — run them manually against PostgreSQL in order. `migration:run` uses TypeORM's data source at `src/database/data-source.ts` (a separate mechanism, used only for the cities table).

All routes are prefixed `/api/v1` (set globally in `main.ts`). Frontend runs on port 3001.

```

### Module conventions

Each module lives in `src/modules/<zone>/<name>/` with its own controller, service, entities, and DTOs. Modules declare their own `JwtModule.registerAsync` when they need JWT — there's no shared auth module export. `CommonModule` is global and provides `PremiumGuard` + `@RequiresPremium()`.

### Cross-module real-time events

Modules communicate via `@nestjs/event-emitter`, not direct service injection. Pattern:

1. Service emits: `this.eventEmitter.emit('user.banned', { userId })`
2. `ChatGateway` listens with `@OnEvent('user.banned')` and pushes to the user's personal socket room `user:{userId}`

There are two WebSocket gateways:
- `ChatGateway` — default namespace `/`, owns all core chat/notification real-time events. Never inject this into other services.
- `HiddenBeefGateway` — namespace `/hidden-beef`, handles beef vote/comment/closed events. Clients join `beef:{id}` rooms.

### Email storage

Emails are **never stored in plaintext**. Storage: AES-256-CBC encrypted blob. Lookups: SHA-256 hash (`EMAIL_SALT`). Both helpers live in `src/common/crypto/crypto.helper.ts` (`encryptField`, `decryptField`).

### RLS

`withRls(dataSource, userId, fn)` wraps a callback in a transaction, issues `SET LOCAL app.current_user_id = $1`, then runs the callback. Used for `profile_sensitive_data` which has RLS policies. `RlsContextMiddleware` decodes the Bearer token and sets `req.rlsUserId` for downstream use — it does **not** verify the token.

### Route ordering

NestJS matches routes top-to-bottom. Always declare named routes (e.g. `@Get('pending')`, `@Get('exile/status')`) **before** parametric routes (`@Get(':id')`) in the same controller, or they'll never be reached.

### Stripe webhooks

`NestFactory.create` is called with `{ rawBody: true }` — required for Stripe signature verification. The webhook endpoint must receive the raw body, not parsed JSON.

### Hidden Zone

`src/modules/hidden/` contains beef/coin/teeth/badge. These share the same JWT auth as core modules. Beef drives coin awards/spends via `CoinService` injection. Badge records are created internally by `BeefService` when a beef resolves — `BadgeModule` has no public write endpoints.

**Beef state machine:** `pending_approval → waiting → active → closed | chickened`
- Admin approval moves `pending_approval → waiting`; target accepting moves `waiting → active`
- `BeefScheduler` (every 1 min) closes `active` beefs where `ends_at < now`
- `BeefScheduler` (every 5 min) auto-chickens `waiting` beefs older than 24h: increments `chicken_count` on target, sets `exile_until = now+24h` on both parties
- An exiled user's `exile_until` is auto-cleared on their next beef creation attempt if the timestamp has passed

**Teeth:** winners collect individual `Tooth` records; 15 unconverted teeth can be transformed into a `ToothChain`.

**Coin packages** are hardcoded constants in `CoinService` (sardine/thunfisch/hai/moby_dick) — not in system settings.

### User roles

`users.role` enum: `user` | `admin` | `org` | `owner`. The `owner` role is the platform owner (set via `/api/v1/setup`).

### Rate limiting

Global throttler: 100 requests per 60 seconds per IP (`ThrottlerGuard` applied via `APP_GUARD`).

### Tests

No `.spec.ts` files exist yet. Jest is configured (`rootDir: src`, `testRegex: *.spec.ts`) and `@nestjs/testing` is installed — write tests in the same directory as the file under test.

### System settings

`SystemSettingsService.getNumber(key, fallback)` / `getString(key, fallback)` — 60 s in-memory cache, invalidated on write. Use these for any owner-configurable value (subscription prices, thresholds) instead of hardcoding.
